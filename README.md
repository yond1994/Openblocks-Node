## What is Openblocks?
Openblocks is a developer-friendly open-source low code platform to build internal apps within minutes.
Traditionally, building an internal app requires complex frontend and backend interactions with hundreds and thousands lines of code, not to mention work on packaging, integration and deployment. Openblocks significantly reduces the work you need to do to build an app.
In Openblocks, all you need to do is drag and drop pre-built or self-customized components onto the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) canvas, along with ready-to-connect databases and APIs, Openblocks helps you build an app quickly and focus on business logic.

2. Write a few lines of SQL or set up request parameters to build queries.
3. Use pre-built or user-customized UI components to build your app UI, bind and display queries' data with UI components.
